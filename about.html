            <h3>Jose P. Alcantara</h3>
            <h5>Pasay City, Philippines 1911</h5>
            <p>Jose P. Alcantara was a famous Filipino sculptor who was born in 1911 and passed away in 2005. He is remembered for his contributions to the rich and diverse Filipino art scene, and is known as one of the greatest sculptors that the country has ever produced. Alcantara was commissioned by the Philam Life Theater to create a kind of counterpoint to Vicente Manansala’s murals in the form of carved wood relief panels running the length of both flanks of the theater’s orchestra. The result was a landmark piece of Filipino sculpture, in both scale and conception: a panoramic reimagining of Philippine history and culture rendered in wood. For decades, generations of theatergoers marveled at the intricacy of the design and the skill it demanded from the woodworkers. In 2019, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Manila displayed Alcantara’s restored masterpiece </p>

            <p>Napoleon Veloso Abueva, also known as Napoleon “Billy” Veloso Abueva, was a Filipino sculptor born on January 26, 1930 in Tagbilaran, Bohol, Philippines. He was proclaimed National Artist for Sculpture in 1976 when he was 46, making him the youngest recipient of the award to date. Abueva is known as the “Father of Modern Philippine Sculpture” and is credited with leading the way for the nation’s sculptors. He explored various media such as molave, acacia, langka, ipil, kamagong, palm, adobe, cement, marble, bronze, iron, brass, among others 3. Abueva’s works have been exhibited in various countries including India, Taipei, and England. He passed away on February 16, 2018 at the age of 88.</p>

            <h3>Nunelucio Alvarado</h3>
            <h5>Negros Occidental, Philippines 1950</h5>
            <p>Nunelucio Alvarado is a Filipino artist born in Sagay, Negros Occidental, Philippines in 1950. He is known for his Social Realist paintings that depict the struggles of peasants and laborers in the sugarcane fields of Negros Occidental. Alvarado’s art is characterized by the stark frontality of his figures, which recall Egyptian paintings with their hieratic presentation of bodies and faces. He was one of the Social Realists who banded together, known as the Kaisahan group, among whom were Edgar Fernandez, Neil Doloricon and Renato Habulan. They were united by a single voice that decried the social injustice and miserable poverty which stalked the country. Alvarado has been a full-time painter for over four decades and has exhibited his works in various countries including India, Taipei, and England </p>

            <h3>Cesar T. Legaspi</h3>
            <h5>Tondo, Manila, Philippines, 1917</h5>
            <p>Cesar Torrente Legaspi was a Filipino National Artist in painting who was born on April 2, 1917 and passed away on April 7, 1994. He was also an art director prior to going full-time in his visual art practice in the 1960s. Legaspi’s early works, alongside those of his peer Hernando Ocampo, are described as depictions of anguish and dehumanization of beggars and laborers in the city. Critics have further cited Legaspi’s having “reconstituted” in his paintings “cubism’s unfeeling, geometric ordering of figures into a social expressionism rendered by interacting forms filled with rhythmic movement”. Legaspi’s major works include “Man and Woman” (alternatively known as “Beggars”) and “Gadgets”. He was an active member of the Art Association of the Philippines and was part of the Neo-Realists. Legaspi had the opportunity to be part of several exhibits abroad, including the First Plastic Arts Conference in Rome in 1953, the São Paulo Biennial in Graphic Arts in 1967 and 1969, and the Wraxall Gallery in London with Filipino artists Mauro Malang Santos and Benedicto Cabrera in 1982 </p>

            <h3>Federico Aguilar Alcuaz</h3>
            <h5>Manila, Philippines, 1932</h5>
            <p>Federico Aguilar Alcuaz was a Filipino painter who was born on June 6, 1932 in Santa Cruz, Manila, Philippines. He studied law at the Ateneo de Manila and finished his degree in 1955. In 1949–1950 he took up painting subjects at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. In 1955 he went to Madrid with a scholarship at the Academia de San Fernando which he got through the help of the Jesuits from the Ateneo de Manila. In 1956 he chose Barcelona as his career base. He also became a member of the La Punalada Group which counted among its members Tàpies, Cuixart and Tharrats. In the same year he began signing his paintings with Aguilar Alcuaz to distinguish himself from two other Aguilars who are also members of the La Punalada Group. Federico Aguilar Alcuaz exhibited extensively internationally and his work earned him recognition both in the Philippines and abroad. He was conferred the title of National Artist for Visual Arts, Painting, Sculpture and Mixed Media in 2009.</p>
